# Sleepy Driver Detection System

### Building a system that will allow a user to use their smartphone to detect when they are getting drowsy and alert them.


## How to use:
1.) install required dependecies: `pip install -r requirments.txt`
  
2.) run the program: `python main.py <camera_ip>`  
*Note: with the camera_ip argument being the IP URL of your the camera in your phone. (May need to download an app for that)*

3.) Put your phone in a mobile holder in your car with a clear visibily of your face
  
4.) Drive as you normally do, and let the app work in the background and alert you in case you feel drowsy and it will wake you.


## Future plans:
Build an app that runs the script in the background with proper UI
